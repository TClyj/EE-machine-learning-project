Author: Yijia Lu

### Abstract: 

This report explores and compares the efficiency of four types of neural network models - Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Echo State Network (ESN) - in predicting the dynamics of the Lorenz system, a complex nonlinear system.

## Introduction and Overview

The Lorenz system, a set of three differential equations, is known for its chaotic behavior and is often used as a benchmark for testing prediction models. In this study, we generate data from the Lorenz system and apply four types of neural networks to predict the system's dynamics. The aim is to compare their performances and identify the most efficient model.

## Theoretical Background

The ***Lorenz system*** is a deterministic, three-dimensional system defined by three nonlinear differential equations. These equations describe the rate of change of three variables in response to three parameters. The system exhibits a range of behaviors as the parameters vary, including stable points, limit cycles, and chaotic behavior.


## Algorithm Implementation and Development




## Computational Results

### Problem 1(i): Reconsider the data from homework one: (i) Fit the data to a three layer feed forward neural network.


## Summary and Conclusions

Through the process of training and evaluating the neural network model using different portions of the dataset, we gain insight into the model's performance and the impact of data splits. Additionally, by comparing the neural network model to other classifiers, we can assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method. This analysis can inform the choice of classifier for specific tasks and guide further optimization of model architectures and hyperparameters.
